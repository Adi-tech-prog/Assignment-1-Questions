Write a C program that takes the length and width of a rectangular yard and the length and width of a rectangular house situated in the yard. Your program should compute the time required to cut the grass at the rate of two square feet a second.
-----------------------------------------------

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float yard_length, yard_width;
    float house_length, house_width;
    float yard_area, house_area, grass_area;
    float time_to_cut_grass;

    // Input length and width of the yard
    printf("Enter the length and width of the yard (in feet): ");
    scanf("%f %f", &yard_length, &yard_width);

    // Input length and width of the house
    printf("Enter the length and width of the house (in feet): ");
    scanf("%f %f", &house_length, &house_width);

    // Calculate areas
    yard_area = yard_length * yard_width;
    house_area = house_length * house_width;
    grass_area = yard_area - house_area;

    // Calculate time to cut grass
    time_to_cut_grass = grass_area / 2.0;

    // Display the time required
    printf("Time required to cut the grass: %.2f seconds\n", time_to_cut_grass);

    return 0;
}


OUTPUT :-
Enter the length and width of the yard (in feet): 100 50
Enter the length and width of the house (in feet): 40 20
Time required to cut the grass: 2380.00 seconds
